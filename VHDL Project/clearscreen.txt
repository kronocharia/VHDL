clearscreen

current waddr will give us bottom left corner of x.

define xmax, ymax from coords of the clear command
define xmin ymin from coords of the previous command

for all the bits in the current adress

are they >= xmin, >= ymin AND <= xmax <= ymax

If so, then cache that thing is the colour of the pen.
